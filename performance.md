# Performance Notes

## 2026-07-09 baseline

This branch started with a single-thread performance attribution pass for the
Numba transport path. `WOMBAT_TPCORE_NUMBA=all` is the current default and was
used for these measurements.

The benchmark scripts now support `--warmup`, defaulting to one untimed run per
tracer count. This avoids timing first-call Numba compilation when collecting
steady-state kernel/runtime numbers.

Benchmarks were run from this worktree with the original checkout's local
fixtures:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/home/mgnb/Projects/UWA/FluxInversion/wombat-transport-transport-performance/src \
NUMBA_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/wombat-numba-cache \
NUMBA_NUM_THREADS=1 \
OMP_NUM_THREADS=1 \
OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1 \
/home/mgnb/Projects/UWA/FluxInversion/wombat-transport/.venv/bin/python \
tools/benchmark_transport_driver_scaling.py \
  --run-config /home/mgnb/Projects/UWA/FluxInversion/wombat-transport/base_wombat/run.yml \
  --counts 1 24 96 \
  --repeat 2 \
  --warmup 1 \
  --output /tmp/wombat-driver-benchmark.csv
```

Equivalent commands were run for `tools/benchmark_tpcore_scaling.py`,
`tools/benchmark_vdiff_scaling.py`, and
`tools/benchmark_convection_scaling.py`.

## Driver attribution

Best timed run by tracer count:

| Tracers | Total s | TPCORE | VDIFF | Convection | Setup | Overhead |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 0.181 | 53.8% | 16.0% | 7.1% | 8.8% | 14.2% |
| 24 | 0.743 | 49.3% | 13.6% | 14.2% | 2.1% | 20.8% |
| 96 | 2.643 | 52.8% | 12.9% | 14.8% | 0.6% | 19.0% |

## Standalone operator timings

Best timed run by tracer count:

| Tracers | TPCORE s | VDIFF s | Convection s |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 0.098 | 0.031 | 0.013 |
| 24 | 0.366 | 0.099 | 0.107 |
| 96 | 1.398 | 0.338 | 0.386 |

## Interpretation

TPCORE is the first optimization target. It accounts for roughly half of the
end-to-end transport step across the measured tracer counts, and its standalone
runtime is well above VDIFF and convection.

Driver overhead is also significant at multi-tracer counts, around 19-21% for
24 and 96 tracers in this run. After TPCORE kernel work, allocation/copy/object
wrapping around the staged driver should be measured directly.

VDIFF and convection are similar in cost by 24-96 tracers. They are not the
first target unless a narrower benchmark or real forcing fixture shows a
different profile.

## Verification notes

The benchmark-script tests passed under the project virtual environment with
this branch on `PYTHONPATH`, excluding only the two synthetic-builder tests that
require large fixture files to exist inside this sibling worktree:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=/home/mgnb/Projects/UWA/FluxInversion/wombat-transport-transport-performance/src \
NUMBA_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/wombat-numba-cache \
/home/mgnb/Projects/UWA/FluxInversion/wombat-transport/.venv/bin/python \
  -m pytest \
  tests/test_tpcore_scaling_benchmark.py \
  tests/test_vdiff_scaling_benchmark.py \
  tests/test_convection_scaling_benchmark.py \
  tests/test_transport_driver_scaling_benchmark.py \
  -k 'not synthetic_builder'
```

Result: 24 passed, 2 deselected.

The large GEOS-Chem fixture files are available in the original checkout, not
copied into this sibling worktree. Benchmark commands therefore used the
original checkout's `base_wombat/run.yml` so grid-template paths resolved to the
real files.
